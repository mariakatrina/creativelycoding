# Who Am I? #

I pondered on the idea of an internet that is full of life and shaped by the humans who created this through their own networks. How I could try and make this a more personal and meaningful experience, to communicate who I am as an artist, a designer. So I thought to blend myself into the project and share my identity and impact on the internet. 

Many times before I’ve been told:

>“If you were a flower, you’d be a sunflower.”

And I was like... _whaaaaaaaat?_

I tried confirming this and asked a few of my close friends and family some questions and the general consensus is as shown:

Admittedly, this small questionairre has definitely paved the look and feel of this project.

I always asked _why_, as I never considered myself to be so bright and a symbol of optimism and happiness. Not to mention the question of why they would relate me to such a large, tall flower when I, as a human person, am quite the opposite (5" shy).

I took a deep dive into this reflection of my identity and thought to myself, maybe there are parts of me I could never see. After all, the sunflower always faces the sun, a brighter being of what this plant was named after. Perhaps by focusing on the brighter, more beautiful and symbolic version of itself, the sunflower cannot take a look at itself and think the same way.

The idea of never seeing who and what I am to my friends and family because of looking at another blindingly beautiful being was huge. 

Maybe I really am a sunflower, symbol of brightness, and happiness. I just kept looking at the sun thinking how much the grass must be greener on the other side. A metaphor of what I could be, never realising who I am to the world the whole time.

After all, my friends know me as _a short person_ with _a TALL personality_.
