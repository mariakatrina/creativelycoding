# Inspiration and Research #

The concept of _‘net art’_ was baffling to me, as I wondered what it was on the internet that we can call art. So I looked for a definition:

>__Net art__: new art media distributed via the internet. The user is drawn into a form of interaction with this new medium.

I considered the idea of the __✨internet✨__ and it’s __vast__ capacity. How each user is able to __branch__ out and communicate throughout the web, worldwide throughout various networks. But let’s talk about this thing; _network_.

A network, by definition, is an arrangement of intersecting, horizontal and vertical lines. It is also defined as a group or a system of interconnection (of people, things or places). By this definition, I would like to make this concept of connectivity, lines and all its intersecting points and crosses the core idea and principle of this project. 

I brainstormed a few ideas on how I can communicate this idea of a ‘network’, and how it can bring meaning to users via _net art_.

I was torn between two designs; a very synthetic aesthetic or an organic aesthetic. But they all share a similar interaction using the same tool: the cursor.

## The Cursor and The Synthetic vs. The Organic ##
I explored the idea of _randomly generated_ lines upon mouse events as it symbolises the impact a single user can make on the internet. From the social, political, economic and environmental, the user's impact through interacting with internet (while hidden) is vast and complex. I wanted to communicate this visually through lines moving along different speeds and lengths, branching into more complex shapes.

I started with the idea of simply illustrating random lines. Each line interconnected like a network, growing along an axis showing the impact the user has with the way they interact with the internet. However, I thought this was too literal, too boring and impersonal. I scrapped it and considered a more _organic_ direction. 

This organic vibe meant that the lines can branch out in multiple directions, making more complex patterns and networks. The user can click and drag, allowing them to create their own maps, with some urgency and control, but not fully. Much like the nature of the internet. The user can control their actions, but there are hidden impacts the user may not know of nor have the ability to control. 

I considered making the design fade, however the internet doesn't work that way. Networks don't simply fade. The artist, the user, makes an impact that lasts forever to each location, each person. Their impact means that nothing is ever the same without their interaction. Not to mention that everything on the internet __CANNOT__ be entirely deleted (and that's terrifying).

This design felt more alive, almost reflective of the humanity behind the internet. Because, behind every function, interaction, view, connection, type, click and drag, is a human person with their own network of thoughts, friends, family and self.
