# IMPACT

This sketch was impossibly hard for me to grasp my head around, however, thanks to this incredible [guide](https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/ "Making Games with p5.play"), I was able to understand how `sprites` and `mouse events` affect p5. I was able to understand and breakdown each code in my p5 sketch after (too much) trial and error of most of the sketches provided. 

I had to add an external library onto my `html` file from the [guide](https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/ "Making Games with p5.play").

This sketch has definitely solidified the concepts of:
1. Sprites,
2. `createSprite()` function,
3. `drawSprite()` function,
4. `velocity` attribute,
5. `onMousePressed` attribute (when the user presses the mouse button, and the mouse cursor is over the object),
6. `if` statements
7. and restricting movements within the canvas' x and y axis.

Thanks to this activity, I realise there is so much p5 can be used for. Games, art and expereinces can be made with such a powerful tool, and I'm surprised I've never heard of it before.

Here you will notice both inspirations shine through:
the value of **IMPACT** and the cute, dynamic and bouncy nature of *Dango* from *Clannad*.

The bouncing of the sprites pays a direct homage to the adorable Japanese sweets as they bounce with gravity and velocity, bumping and colliding into each other.

The theme of **IMPACT** is especially present here as the user is given an interaction to not only create a direct impact onto this digital space, but also impact upon the shapes present within the space (other sprites made by the user). It's almost like a metaphor for how much change we can make within a creative space, as well as a visual representation of how we can influence people and objects around us in the physical space. 

The clicking action of the mouse brings the user into the space and allows them to personalise and make their own experience, to bring their own ideas to the space and make something new.
