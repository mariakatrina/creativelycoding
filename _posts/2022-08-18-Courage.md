# COURAGE

Similarly to Passion, I picked apart the idea of **Courage** and the ideas and emotions that come to mind. I found that the idea of "moving forward" is the best visual I can link to this concept. I was inspired by the movements of *Dango* from Clannad and wanted to incoroporate dynamically moving objects. I researched some code online and found this code by [mbardin](https://editor.p5js.org/mbardin/sketches "mbardin") and wanted to try putting a twist on their sketch.

I had utilised their text and made a bunch of circles move around randomly, some dynamically and some still, as I had intended. They are always moving forwards to a positive value along either the x or y axis (left to right, down to up). I believe that their state of constantly moving positively along an axis reflects the feeling of courage, of pushing through whatever happens.
