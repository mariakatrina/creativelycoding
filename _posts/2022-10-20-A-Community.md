Before delving into what I want to focus on with my assignment, I want to explore the idea of a community. What it means for me, for those within the community and for the greater society.

The Oxford Dictionary defines a community as

> a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common

Upon evaluation of myself and of what this means to others, a community is much richer than to being defined simply as a gathering of a collective group with similarities, but rather, communities are people. Individuals. Not the rhetoric, or the common traits and beliefs. 

Simply human beings, complex, but together who share a sense of belonging and interpersonal connection. My community of focus is one that has connected individuals for not one, but two things in which they love and believe in:

1. Catholicism (and their faith)
2. Music (Worship)


# CFC: YOUTH FOR CHRIST

I aimed to highlight these two in my chosen community: CFC Youth For Christ (YFC). 

Before delving into my exploration on what to deliver, I want to talk a little bit about YFC and what this community means to me.

YFC is a Catholic evangelistic ministry that spans all across the globe for Catholic youths. They bond together through fun, friendship, freedom and their faith. YFC has given me not just a community, but a family. I've dedicated over 5 years in service and volunteering for the church and my community, so I've made some of my strongest life-long friendships bonded through our love of creativity, music and our Catholic faith. 

It's a powerful thing being bound together with a common faith, as we all strive to be kinder and better as people not just to each other, but to the greater society. We've volunteered on missions which involve helping the poor, the vulnerable and the sick as well as raise fundraisers together. We also lead conferences where we do all kinds of activities from sports to music and visual art. We've held small music and art shows to support each other of the creative talents and endeavours.

A community binded by faith sharing their blessings to the world.

I get a little emotional thinking about everything I've been through with the community, it means so much to me and my personal growth to make a project on them.

Initally I struggled to come up with an idea on how to present this to the community, but I realised that a big essense of YFC is worship and music. Song is what brings out the believer in their rawest and vulnerable form; as it is a prayer that the community sings and plays instruments together.

Worship moves the hearts of youth as music becomes a powerful tool to connecting the believers to their faith, whilst also allowed to sing praise with joy, and no one cares if oyou're singing off pitch; its just about releasing a love for a religion which makes people in the community kinder to each other.

These shared, strong feelings with faith is what essential drives the interpersonal connection between the youth in the community, as they are encouraged to do sing and play and even dance to these feelings with each other and bond at the same time.
