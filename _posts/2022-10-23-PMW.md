 Initially I wanted to try exploring the idea of prayer as the main topic. I wanted to create a 3D interactive environment where the community members can interact with (like a bedroom) and find places where they can pray. Similar to the study tool *Virtual Cottage*.

 The room will have points of interest (perhaps dots) where the player can click on, and each spot will generate a Bible verse to reflect on.

 However, I decided against the idea as I thought it was a little shallow. Creating a virutal prayer room for a Catholic youth group is typical. But prayer is definitely an integral part of the community's values and repertoire.

 So I dug into the idea of music. Music, to me and a lot of the youth in the community, is what started the bond between the individual and the community. Music connected all of us together. Singing, playing instruments and worship was where a lot of us started our relationship with our faith and each other.

 I'll admit, it's hard to connect with my faith. I live in a mostly secular country and remaining faithful is hard when the people around me aren't. I'll admit, the increasing hostility towards religion has incredibly affected my faith too.

 It's definitely charismatic and helpful when music is used as a tool to evangelise, as music is a universal language. It's in the secular and religious world. It's a bridge that encourages creativity and expression. It comes from the heart and mind of humans, made from human emotion. It's incredibly easy to connect to.  

 Music and prayer over music helped me find my faith and it's helped others in my community find theirs too. So I changed my focus and turned to music and prayer; worship.

 I had played with the idea of how I can communicate worship in the community. So I thought about audio visualisers!
