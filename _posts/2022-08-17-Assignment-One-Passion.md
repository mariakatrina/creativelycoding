# PASSION

I took a deep dive to what the word `Passion` meant, both personally and with the eye of a designer. I looked for emotions that could come out of the word and I found keywords that link to the concept that helped me out.

### Keywords
1. If it were a colour: **RED** (RMIT colour)
2. Urge and Love
3. BIG and BOLD

and some potential ideas:
- Static image? (scrapped as it may be boring)
- Animate a beating heart
    - links to love and a heart (words often associated with passion)



I was looking for ways to animate a beating heart in p5. I stumbled upon this sketch and wanted to see how I could incorporate it into my design for the theme of **Passion**.

Implementing the sketch onto my idea was tricky. I kept running into the issue of the text flipping along the y axis. I separated the circles and I think one of the animations influenced the change to the text. Once I split the circles to two separate codes, the problem was resolved. 

I enjoy the dynamic effect splitting the two cicrcles made, as I could control the speed and radius of each circle expanding. I made it so that the circle in the middle expands twice, once big and another time much smaller. This allowed me to make the design almost seem like its A *~HEART BEATING~*.
