Making an audio visualiser, I wanted to use the camera as a main tool to symbolise how the community included the people, the youth, and that was the person behind the camera. That they were part of the music, and they were part of the art.

I also wanted to use the microphone, and how this tool can pick up sound and music, which will be used to translate sound to music. The microphone is often used in the community not just for singing and hosting events, but for prayer and worship too. I wanted to make sure that this tool was used as it quite literally calls the community together.

## Hydra?

I was excited to learn about [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) made by [Olivia Jack](https://ojack.xyz/) and how I could make interesting compositions with the language. I made a [sketch](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_id=VznhJoy0cYV8s9XO) with the language, utlising the camera. However, I found that this was a little hard to see the camera and the effects on hydra has a hint of psychedelia. I also wanted to utilise the sound waves and the visualising those.

## So I found tutorials:

I've put together an audio visualiser through [p5 Sound tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aFcVjlDAkkGIixw70s7jpW) found on Youtube with [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain). The p5 Sketch looks like this:

I used the colour green as it's the logo colour of the community and applied a tint effect onto the camera so the visuals and the camera blends together harmoniously. The audio lines are glowing and in a circle for two reasons:
1. a visual motif of completeness and community and 
2. depicting a halo (used in representations of Christ, the angels, and the saints throughout the Middle Ages, prominent in Christian art).

Music affects this shape and flows through it the same way music affects the prayer life of the Youths of the community.

Therefore makes this an audio-visual representation of worship, which shines best when music is played through the microphone with a group of people or band.

# In Conclusion

For my community of CFC Youth For Christ;

I've identified:
1. DOMAIN 
  * Playing music and playing in worship together
  * In smaller, intimate locations like homes or bigger presentation / convention centres
  * Use of the microphone and camera to create a recording
2. REPERTOIRE  
  * Playing instruments as a BAND
  * Praying with music
  * Capturing a moment
3. SHARED VALUES
  * a creative outlet for evangelism 
  * singing and praising a common faith
  * makes room for fun (and cheeky improvs) with music and prayer

## The Take Aways

**INTERESTING**

It was fun seeing how the youth react to their impact on the audio visualiser, and how excited they were to try it out and test it with their instruments. They even freestyled and one of the boys sampled the 1994 version of the Nokia ringtone.

**POTENTIAL**
*  interesting visual for live streams or music videos
*  stage design playing within a screen or projection with a stage set up with or behind the band

**THE MORE I PRACTICE**

I found that even in something as robotic and boring as computer science and coding, I can implement creativity in how users interact with their physical devices and digital tools in my current and future professional design practice.
