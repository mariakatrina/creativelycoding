Before going into the project, I had to define and breakdown JavaScript terms to get a good idea of what I need to do.



It took a while to think of how to start this assignment, so I took inspiration from two things:

{% highlight ruby %}
My Inspirations:
1. RMITs values
2. Clannads dango animation
{% endhighlight %}

Not to be a nerd but looking at the assignment brief I was immediately drawn to the RMIT brand guide. I wanted to pick it apart and see what I could make out of the guide. I was particularly inspired by the colour palette, and appreciated how nice they harmonise with each other, all different yet mix and blend well together.

I wanted to bring RMIT's vision to life through emphasising on the values of `PASSION`, `IMPACT` and `COURAGE` and think of ways to creaticely communicate them along with the `RMIT CREATIVE CODING SPECIALISATION` text.

My second inspiration comes from my first childhood love, anime. Like many, I fell in love with the cute dango animation from Clannad's closing song. I loved how each of the cute Japanese snacks `interacted with each other`. How `simple` their shapes were, yet so `dynamic`. They are true icons within the anime genre.

I wanted to adapt their endearing, dynamic elements into my designs to make them fun to look at and perhaps interact with. You can see the influence on my brainstorms and sketches.
