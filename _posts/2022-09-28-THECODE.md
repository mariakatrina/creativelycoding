# THE PROJECT #

It was incredibly tricky making this project and I was introduced to a number of new things, especially in Javascript. I learned the concepts of:

1. Creating a `canvas`
    - {% highlight ruby %} const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas1'); {% endhighlight %}

2. Custom `function()`s
3. `constructor`s
4. `random()`
5. `addEventListener`s
6. `variables`s and arrays
7. iterations
8. tertiary operators
9. conditional logic
10. classes
11. recursive functions

Such is found within the [code](https://github.com/mariakatrina/net.art/blob/main/script.js) (although not explicitly mentioned).

I wanted my concept to come to life, so I opted for this net art as a metaphor of a _garden_, whilst maintaining the concept of networks and the internet. This was done through creating roots and sequences from `constructor`s and `random()` values and variables.

I felt that using a garden as a metaphor will serve as a symbolism to the impact a user can grow on the internet, and how they can artfully express their identities online though all the complex branches and networks. I made this work my own by taking all the things on how my identity is perceived and moulding this project around my persona (sunflowers, yellow, artist).

I drew the sunflowers on __Procreate__ and they emerge as you draw on the canvas, adding this sense of beauty and life within each interaction.

This is also used as the favicon.

I owe a lot to [Frank's Labroatory](https://www.youtube.com/c/Frankslaboratory) and their video tutorial [Generative Art with Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v4_Dw0K8pw&ab_channel=Frankslaboratory) on Youtube. It was incredibly educational and fun learning Javascript through them.
